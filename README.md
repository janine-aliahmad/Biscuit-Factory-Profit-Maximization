# Biscuit Factory Profit Maximization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing **profit maximization** for a **biscuit factory** using **AI algorithms**. As part of an **AI algorithms course**, the goal was to explore different optimization techniques, analyze their efficiency, and interpret the results. The project involved implementing and comparing **search-based, constraint-based, and evolutionary approaches**. More details are provided directly on the notebook

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Explores feasible production configurations.
   - Used for exhaustive search in small-scale scenarios.
2. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP):**
   - Ensures compliance with factory constraints (e.g., resource availability, machine limits, labor shifts).
3. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):**
   - Implements **selection, crossover, and mutation** for evolving optimal production.
   - Evaluates fitness based on profit maximization criteria.

## Interpretations and Analysis
1. **Algorithm Performance Comparison:**
   - Compared solution quality, runtime, and efficiency across algorithms.
2. **Constraint Analysis:**
   - Evaluated the impact of different constraints on the optimal solution.
3. **Profit Maximization Interpretation:**
   - Derived insights on how production parameters influence profitability.
